            When I ran Built for Devs as an agency, I&apos;d bring in developers
            matching my clients&apos; target audience to try their product and
            share honest feedback. Those sessions drove the biggest impact,
            bigger than any strategy doc or campaign.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I pivoted to focus entirely on this. Candid feedback from the
            right developers creates breakthroughs. That&apos;s all we do.
