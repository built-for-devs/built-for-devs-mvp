# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** Built for Devs gives companies building developer products candid feedback from their target developers through recorded product evaluations.
**What it does:** We recruit developers from a 6,000+ network who match a company's target audience, have them try the product while screen-recording and thinking out loud, and deliver the unedited recordings plus a findings report with prioritized friction points and quick wins.
**Product category:** Developer experience research / developer product evaluation
**Product type:** Service (transitioning to platform/marketplace)
**Business model:** Pay per evaluation. Founders purchase evaluations; developers in the network get paid via PayPal to perform them. Price: $399 per evaluation.

## Target Audience
**Target companies:** Early-stage startups building software products for developers (APIs, SDKs, dev tools, developer platforms)
**Decision-makers:** Founders, CEOs, heads of product, DevRel leads
**Primary use case:** Understanding why developers aren't adopting their product
**Jobs to be done:**
- Find out where developers get stuck, confused, or quit during first use
- Get honest feedback from developers who match their target audience (not friends, not colleagues)
- Prioritize what to fix to improve developer adoption
**Use cases:**
- Pre-launch product validation with target developers
- Diagnosing drop-off and low adoption post-launch
- Evaluating onboarding, docs, and first-run experience
- Gathering evidence for product/roadmap decisions

## Personas
| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Founder/CEO (primary buyer) | Product-market fit, developer adoption, not wasting runway | Can't tell if the product or the marketing is the problem; developers sign up and vanish | See exactly why developers aren't adopting and what to fix first |
| Head of Product / PM | UX quality, onboarding completion, feature prioritization | Analytics show drop-off but not *why*; too close to the product to see friction | Watch real developers hit friction you'd never find yourself |
| DevRel Lead (potential, not primary) | Developer satisfaction, DX quality, community growth | Needs to advocate for DX improvements but lacks concrete evidence to bring to product teams; DevRel budgets are tight right now | Give your product team undeniable proof of where the DX breaks down |

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** Founders build products for developers but can't get honest, actionable feedback on why developers aren't adopting.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- **User interviews:** Developers are too polite, too biased, or not the right audience. You get "looks cool" and then silence.
- **Analytics/heatmaps:** Show *that* developers left, not *why*. Numbers without context.
- **Internal testing:** You're too close to your own product to feel the friction a new developer feels.
- **Usability testing platforms:** Generic testers, task-based flows, not developer-specific. They don't replicate how a real developer would discover and try your product.
**What it costs them:** Wasted runway building the wrong things, lost developers who won't give a second chance, slow path to product-market fit.
**Emotional tension:** "Am I building the wrong thing?" Uncertainty, isolation, feeling like you're shouting into a void.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** No one is doing developer-specific product evaluations. This is whitespace.
**Secondary:** Wynter (on-demand B2B message testing with a 70K+ panel, but targets business buyers/CMOs, not developers; tests messaging copy, not product experience). General usability testing platforms (UserTesting, Maze) that don't specialize in developers or replicate natural developer behavior.
**Indirect:** Doing it yourself (user interviews, analytics-only approach, asking friends/colleagues), hiring a DevRel consultant.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- Developer-specific: 6,000+ developer network matched by language, experience, specialization
- Natural behavior: developers explore freely, not following scripted tasks
- Think-aloud recordings: you hear *why* they're confused, not just see where they clicked
- Findings report: prioritized friction points and quick wins, not raw data
- Speed: recordings delivered as each developer finishes, report within days
**How we do it differently:** We don't run scripted usability tests. Developers try the product the way they would in real life, cold, while narrating their honest reactions.
**Why that's better:** You see the real first-time developer experience, not a simulation of it. The friction that surfaces is the friction that actually costs you adoption.
**Why customers choose us:** "The ROI was HUGE. What we got from Built for Devs was completely different: actionable, clear insights that gave us a real sense of where to go next."

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can just ask developers myself" | The developers you know are too polite or too close to give you the unfiltered truth. Our developers have no relationship with you and no reason to hold back. |
| "Isn't this just usability testing?" | Usability testing gives developers tasks to complete. We let developers explore naturally, the way they would in real life. That's how you find the friction that actually matters. |
| "How do I know the developers match my audience?" | You define the criteria: language, experience level, specialization, and more. We match from a 6,000+ network, mostly US-based. |

**Anti-persona:** Companies not building for developers. Enterprise companies looking for large-scale quantitative research. Founders who want validation, not honest feedback.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Analytics aren't explaining drop-off. User interviews produce polite but useless feedback. Guessing what to fix is burning runway.
**Pull:** See real developers try your product honestly. Get a clear action plan. Fast turnaround.
**Habit:** "We'll just talk to a few more developers ourselves." Relying on analytics dashboards. Assuming the product is fine and the problem is marketing.
**Anxiety:** "Will the developers actually match my audience?" "What if the feedback isn't actionable?" "Is $199 per evaluation worth it at our stage?"

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "Developers sign up and then never come back"
- "Everyone says it looks cool but nobody actually uses it"
- "I have no idea what part of the onboarding is broken"
- "I can't tell if the product is the problem or the marketing"
- [NEEDS INPUT - More verbatim phrases from sales calls or support]
**How they describe us:**
- "Actionable, clear insights that gave us a real sense of where to go next"
- "Critical to our process"
- "Completely different from what we'd tried before"
**Words to use:** developers, adoption, friction, evaluate, honest feedback, first-time experience, screen recordings, findings report
**Words to avoid:** funnel, score, usability testing, insights (overused), synergy, leverage, optimize
**Glossary:**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Product evaluation | A recorded session where a developer tries the product and narrates their experience |
| Findings report | Prioritized summary of friction points and quick wins delivered after evaluations |
| Think-aloud | The developer narrates their thoughts while using the product |
