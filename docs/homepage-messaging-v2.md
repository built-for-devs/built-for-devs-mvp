# Homepage Messaging V2: VBF Framework

*Draft: February 2026*

---

## Current Messaging Analysis

**What works:**
- "How it works" section is clear and well-structured
- Deplyr testimonial is outcome-focused and compelling
- Social proof logos establish credibility
- Tessa's origin story builds trust

**What needs to change:**
- **Headline** ("You're losing developers before they even hit your funnel"): "funnel" sounds like a marketing analytics tool, not a product evaluation. Early-stage founders don't think in funnel terms; they think "developers aren't using my product and I don't know why."
- **"Get Your Score" CTA**: Unclear. What score? This sounds like a benchmarking tool. Should say what they're actually getting.
- **"Why developer insights?" section**: Leads with Tessa's story instead of the customer's problem. Story should be secondary.
- **Most testimonials** are about Tessa as a person, not about product evaluation outcomes. The Deplyr quote is the only one focused on results.
- **"Discover how likely developers are to adopt your product"**: Frames the product as a prediction tool. It's actually a diagnostic tool. Founders want to know *why* developers aren't adopting, not a probability score.
- **Missing:** No clear articulation of the three core benefits. No FAQ or objection-handling.

## VBF Messaging Framework

### A+ Customer
Early-stage founder building a software product for developers. Probably technical themselves. They've built something, maybe gotten some initial traction, and they're stuck wondering why developers aren't adopting. They may have tried gathering feedback through user interviews (developers are too polite), analytics (tells you *what* happened, not *why*), or their own testing (too close to the product to see friction).

**BBQ-test pain:** "I built this thing for developers and I have no idea why they're not using it. Everyone says it looks cool and then never comes back."

### Value Proposition
**Find out exactly why developers aren't adopting your product.**

Real developers try your product, record their screen, and tell you exactly what they think. You get the recordings and a report with your biggest friction points and quickest wins.

*Formula: Command ("Now you can ___")*
*Score: Clarity 5, Uniqueness 4, Truth 5 = 14/15*

### Benefit 1: Honest feedback from your target developers
**Pain:** The developers you talk to are too polite, too biased, or not your target audience.

**Headline:** Get candid reactions from developers who match your exact audience.

**Support:** We recruit from our 6,000+ developer network using criteria that match your product: language, experience level, specialization, and more. No friends being nice. No colleagues being diplomatic. Just honest first impressions from the developers you actually need to win over.

*Features: 6,000+ US-based developer network, multi-criteria matching, custom developer profiles*

### Benefit 2: See exactly where they get stuck
**Pain:** Analytics show you drop-off numbers but never explain *why*. Heatmaps show clicks but not confusion.

**Headline:** Watch real developers hit the friction you can't see yourself.

**Support:** You get unedited screen recordings of developers navigating your product for the first time, thinking out loud as they go. You'll hear every moment of confusion, frustration, and excitement. It's the closest thing to sitting behind a developer as they try your product.

*Features: Unedited screen recordings, think-aloud narration, first-time experience capture*

### Benefit 3: Know what to fix first
**Pain:** Even with feedback, it's hard to prioritize. Everything feels urgent when developers are dropping off.

**Headline:** Get a clear report showing your biggest friction points and quickest wins.

**Support:** Within days, you receive a findings report that cuts through the noise: the patterns across evaluations, the friction that's costing you the most adoption, and the changes that'll have the fastest impact. Stop guessing where to start.

*Features: Findings report delivered in days, prioritized friction points, quick-win recommendations*

## Homepage Copy Draft

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
You built it for developers. Find out why they're not using it.

**Subheadline:**
Developers from our network try your product and record their honest reactions. You get screen recordings and a findings report showing your biggest friction points and quickest wins.

**Primary CTA:** Get a Product Evaluation
**Secondary CTA:** See How It Works

**Social proof bar:** Trusted by teams at [logos]

---

### "The Problem" Section

**Section headline:** You can't fix what you can't see

Developers drop off and you're left guessing. Analytics show *that* they left, not *why*. User interviews turn into polite nods. And you're too close to your own product to feel the friction a new developer feels.

Meanwhile, every developer who bounces is one who probably won't come back.

---

### "How It Works" Section

**Section headline:** How it works

**Step 1: Define your target developer**
We work with you to pinpoint the exact developer profile you need feedback from: language, experience level, specialization, and what matters to your product.

**Step 2: We recruit and match**
We find developers from our 6,000+ network who match your criteria and have them try your product cold.

**Step 3: They try your product (on camera)**
Developers navigate your product for the first time while screen-recording and thinking out loud. No scripts. No guidance. Just an honest first experience.

**Step 4: You get recordings + a findings report**
Within days, you receive the unedited recordings plus a report highlighting your biggest friction points and quickest wins.

**CTA:** Get a Product Evaluation

---

### Benefits Section

**Section headline:** What you get

**Benefit 1: Feedback from developers who actually match your audience**
Not your coworkers. Not your friends. Developers with the right background, experience, and tools. The ones you actually need to win over.

**Benefit 2: See friction you'd never find yourself**
Watch developers hit the exact moments where your docs confuse them, your onboarding loses them, or your product just doesn't click. Unedited. Unfiltered.

**Benefit 3: A clear picture of what to fix first**
Your findings report cuts through the noise: the patterns, the biggest friction points, and the changes that'll have the most impact on adoption. Stop guessing where to start.

### Social Proof / Testimonial Section

**Section headline:** Hear it from our clients

> "The ROI was HUGE. What we got from Built for Devs was completely different: actionable, clear insights that gave us a real sense of where to go next. Honestly, this was critical to our process. We wouldn't have been able to get these results on our own."
> - Founder and CEO, Deplyr

*[Add 1-2 more outcome-focused testimonials as they come in. Deprioritize testimonials about Tessa personally; move those to an About page.]*

---

### Tessa's Story Section (shortened, moved lower)

**Section headline:** Why developer evaluations?

When I ran Built for Devs as an agency, I'd bring in developers matching my clients' target audience to try their product and share honest feedback. Those sessions drove the biggest impact, bigger than any strategy doc or campaign.

So I pivoted to focus entirely on this. Candid feedback from the right developers creates breakthroughs. That's all we do.

---

### FAQ / Objection-Handling Section

**Section headline:** Questions

**What kind of developers do the evaluations?**
Our network is 6,000+ developers, mostly US-based, spanning frontend, backend, full-stack, mobile, DevOps, and more. We match them to your product based on language, experience level, specialization, and other criteria you define.

**How fast do I get results?**
You get each screen recording as soon as a developer finishes, so you can start watching right away. Once all evaluations are complete, your findings report follows within a day or two.

**What does the report actually look like?**
A prioritized breakdown of the biggest friction points developers hit, patterns across evaluations, and quick-win recommendations. It's a clear action plan, not a data dump.

**How many evaluations do I need?**
You choose how many you want. Even one evaluation surfaces friction you'd never catch on your own. Most clients see clear patterns emerge around 4-5 developers.

**Is this usability testing?**
It's closer to a product evaluation than traditional usability testing. Developers aren't given tasks to complete. They explore your product the way they would in real life. That's how you find the friction that matters.

**What if my product isn't ready yet?**
If a developer can sign up and try it, it's ready enough. Early feedback saves you from building in the wrong direction.
