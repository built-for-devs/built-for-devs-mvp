## Score Crawler v3 — Link-Driven Architecture

**What was done:**
- Rewrote crawler to be fully link-driven: starts from homepage, discovers documentation via actual `<a>` tags rather than speculative path probing
- Eliminated false broken-link reports that confused the scoring
- Added personal note field to admin score emails

**Decisions made:**
- **Link-driven over path-guessing**: Previous version tried common paths (`/docs`, `/api-reference`, `/developers`). This produced false 404s that the AI scored negatively. New version only visits pages it finds linked from the site itself — much more accurate
- **Personal note on emails**: Admin can add a custom message to score result emails. Makes outreach feel less automated

## Folk Enrichment Pipeline

**What was done:**
- Full developer enrichment pipeline: import from Folk CRM → GitHub discovery via Serper → profile + repo analysis → Claude extraction
- Developer editing: full admin editing of all developer fields (not just quick-edit)
- Location filters on developer list (city, state, country search)
- Pricing clarity improvements on buy page

**Decisions made:**
- **Folk as source of truth for contacts**: Folk CRM has the relationship data. We import contacts, enrich with GitHub/AI data, and sync status back
- **Serper for GitHub discovery**: Google search via API to find developer GitHub profiles from their name + company. More reliable than LinkedIn scraping for finding GitHub URLs
- **Claude for extraction**: After finding GitHub profile + repos, Claude Haiku analyzes the data to extract structured fields (seniority, languages, frameworks, etc.)

**Gotchas:**
- FAQ eval count said "5 developers" but minimum was actually 3 — updated to match
