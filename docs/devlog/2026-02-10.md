## Developer Adoption Score — Lead Gen Tool

**What was done:**
- Built the Developer Adoption Score: a public tool where companies submit their product URL, we crawl it, and AI evaluates their developer experience
- Crawl pipeline: discover docs/API/SDK pages → fetch content → Claude Sonnet analysis → score 0-100 with category breakdown
- Score results page with findings report, improvement suggestions, and CTA to buy developer evaluations
- Admin scores dashboard with token usage tracking and cost display
- PostHog analytics integration for page view tracking

**Decisions made:**
- **AI scoring as lead gen**: Free value-first approach. Companies get an honest score, we get their email and a warm intro to paid evaluations
- **Sonnet over Haiku for scoring**: Quality matters more than cost here — this is the first impression. Token cost tracked for monitoring
- **Crawl then analyze (not real-time)**: Process takes 30-60s, so we create a pending record, process async, and poll for results
- **Score history by domain**: Track re-scores over time with delta indicators so companies can measure improvement

**Gotchas:**
- Resend email sending failed silently — `@react-email/render` wasn't a direct dependency, only transitive. Fixed by adding it explicitly
- Score emails needed parallelized DB update + email send to avoid timeout
- Rate limiting on Vercel needs `x-real-ip` header, not `req.ip`

## Marketing Homepage and Product Directory

**What was done:**
- Marketing homepage with hero, how-it-works, pricing section (min 3 evaluations enforced), and product screenshots
- Public product directory showing scored companies with scores, deltas, and "Get Your Score" CTAs
- Post-score quick buy flow: score → see results → immediately purchase evaluations
- Custom branding: website-logo.png in headers, custom favicon.png

**Decisions made:**
- **Homepage as root route**: Previously root went to login. Now public marketing page at `/`, auth pages at `/login`, `/signup`
- **Directory as social proof**: Public page showing other companies' scores builds credibility and FOMO
- **Quick buy flow**: Reduce friction from score → purchase. ICP fields relaxed to increase developer matching

## Admin and Developer UX Improvements

**What was done:**
- Job title column in admin developers list
- LinkedIn quick-access button per developer
- "Add to Project" button on developer detail page
- Inline quick-edit for developer matching fields
- Admin score submission form (bypasses rate limiting for testing)
- Admin delete, directory opt-out controls
- Auto-create company records from score submissions

**Gotchas:**
- Developer import via `auth.admin.createUser` needed service role client
- Pagination with `onClick` handlers didn't work with browser navigation — switched to `href` links
