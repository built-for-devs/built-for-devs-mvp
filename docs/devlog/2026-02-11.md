## Homepage Polish and Copy Iteration

**What was done:**
- Multiple rounds of homepage copy refinement: hero headline, subtitle, sub-headline, how-it-works section
- Rewrote pricing bullets as benefits not features
- Tightened hero padding and headline line height
- Updated nav labels and FAQ heading
- Reordered nav and footer links

**Decisions made:**
- **Benefits over features in pricing**: "Get honest feedback from real developers" > "Access to developer network"
- **Renamed CTAs**: "Get Your Score" → "Get Started" — less confusing for visitors who don't know what the score is yet

## Blog Section

**What was done:**
- Added blog with 6 initial posts, hero images, and OG metadata
- Dynamic base URL for social sharing (replaced hardcoded `builtfor.dev`)

**Decisions made:**
- **Static blog over CMS**: Content changes rarely, no need for a CMS. Markdown-in-code is simpler for a solo founder
- **OG metadata per post**: Important for social sharing — each post gets its own title, description, and hero image

## Developer Signup and Public Pages

**What was done:**
- Streamlined developer signup flow
- Added public developer profile pages
- Improved developer section messaging and meta descriptions
- Example evaluation FAQ with embedded YouTube video

**Decisions made:**
- **Public developer pages**: Developers can share their profile link. Builds the network effect — more developers visible → more companies interested

## Score Crawler v2 — Tabstack Integration

**What was done:**
- Improved score crawler with Tabstack (headless browser service) for JS-rendered sites
- Better documentation discovery: follows links from landing pages, finds API docs, SDK references
- 3x content cap increase for more thorough analysis
- Smarter fallback and soft 404 detection to reduce wasted crawl credits

**Decisions made:**
- **Tabstack over raw fetch**: Many developer docs are SPAs (React/Vue). Raw HTTP fetch gets empty shells. Tabstack renders JS and returns the actual content
- **Link-following over speculative paths**: Instead of guessing `/docs`, `/api`, `/sdk`, follow actual links from the page. Less waste, more accurate

**Gotchas:**
- Admin pagination broken by TextSearch `useEffect` loop — infinite re-renders when search param changed. Fixed with proper dependency array
- Soft 404 detection: Some sites return 200 for all paths with a "page not found" message. Added content heuristics to detect these
