## Dark Mode and Developer Join Improvements

**What was done:**
- Dark/light mode toggle with dark variant of website logo
- Developer join flow improvements (onboarding UX)
- Score evaluation prompt improvements: quality + breadth signals for more nuanced scoring
- Directory pagination reset fix and SPA site crawl quality detection

## Homepage Developer Feed with Direct Checkout

**What was done:**
- Homepage section showing available developers with anonymized preview
- Direct checkout flow: browse developers → select → buy evaluations, all from the homepage
- Reduced friction from "learn about service" to "buy now"

**Decisions made:**
- **Developer feed on homepage**: Shows the value immediately — visitors see real developers available for evaluations. Anonymized to protect privacy until purchase
- **Direct checkout over inquiry flow**: Reduce steps. If someone sees a developer they want feedback from, let them buy immediately

## Import & Enrich Pipeline Expansion

**What was done:**
- Full import pipeline: Folk CRM → developer records → GitHub discovery → SixtyFour email discovery → enrichment
- Folk sync-back: write enrichment results back to Folk CRM
- Score retry logic with admin retry button and friendly error messages
- Raised import batch limit to 50, chunked discovery and enrichment

**Decisions made:**
- **SixtyFour for email discovery**: Professional email finder service. After finding GitHub, discovers work email for outreach
- **Chunked processing**: Import 50 contacts but process discovery/enrichment in smaller batches to avoid timeouts

## GitHub Discovery Improvements

**What was done:**
- Multiple rounds of improving GitHub URL discovery:
  - Broader Serper queries: "Name github" in addition to `site:github.com`
  - LinkedIn slug matching against GitHub usernames
  - Crawl personal websites for GitHub links before falling back to SixtyFour
  - Extract all social links from websites (not just GitHub)
  - Repo URL extraction from search results
- "Has GitHub" filter toggle (All / Has / Missing) on admin developers page
- Alternative email collection across all enrichment pipelines

**Decisions made:**
- **Multi-strategy GitHub discovery**: No single search query finds everyone. Cascade: direct Serper search → personal website crawl → LinkedIn slug match → broader name search
- **Website social link extraction**: Many developers list GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn on their personal site. Extract all of them in one pass
- **"Missing" filter**: Quick way to find developers who still need enrichment attention

**Gotchas:**
- `site:github.com` search was too restrictive — many developers' GitHub profiles don't rank well. Broader "Name github" search found more results
- Auto-SixtyFour in the discovery cascade caused unwanted API calls — removed it, made SixtyFour manual-submit only
- Filter option deduplication: array values in DB had inconsistent casing. Fixed by normalizing to lowercase

## Company Management Improvements

**What was done:**
- Company edit and delete from list page (previously only from detail page)
- Leadership title filter for Folk imports
- Dev.to URL field on developer profiles
- Folk API rate limiting to avoid 429 errors
