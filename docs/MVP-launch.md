Here's the updated plan with everything integrated:

---

## Phase 1: Platform & Messaging Ready

**Website & Product**
- Improve homepage messaging (lead with the problem founders feel using VBF framework)
- Review and tighten product evaluations page copy
- Add FAQ / objection-handling section to the evaluations page (what kind of developers, how fast results come, what the report looks like)
- Point all CTAs to the MVP (audit every page, social bio links, newsletter, etc.)
- Test the end-to-end flow yourself — founder signup through purchase, developer signup through profile completion
- Set up analytics and conversion tracking on homepage, evaluations page, and checkout flow before driving any traffic

**Operations & Data**
- Enrich developer profiles in Folk
- Import enriched developers into the platform
- Verify ClarityFlow integration works for new evaluations
- Confirm Stripe checkout and PayPal payout flows work end-to-end

**Proof Assets**
- Create 1-2 case studies from past consulting evaluations (anonymized if needed — the Deplyr findings report is your template)
- Get Kevin working on video snippets from existing live evaluations for use on website and social

**Brand Consistency**
- Update all social profiles (LinkedIn, X, anywhere Built for Devs appears) to match current messaging and link to MVP

---

## Phase 2: Content & Social Engine

**Content Strategy**
- Plan social strategy across your personal profiles and Built for Devs
- Plan content calendar mixing: developer insight posts from past evaluations, building in public updates, provocative developer GTM takes, and direct pilot CTAs
- Write and queue the first 2 weeks of content before you start posting

**Livestream**
- Plan, invite, and schedule the weekly group evaluation livestream
- Lock the format and have your first 3-4 episodes queued with willing devs

**Pre-Launch Email Sequence**
- Write a 2-3 email warm-up sequence to your 6,000+ developer audience: "something's coming" → "here's what Built for Devs is" → "we're live, here's how to get involved"
- Segment the list: developers who should sign up to evaluate vs. founders/leaders who should buy

---

## Phase 3: Outreach & Sales

**Founder Acquisition (10 pilot companies)**
- Direct outreach to founders you already know — warm first, cold second
- Use Common Room to build segments and outreach checklists
- Have discounted pilot offer ($199) clearly articulated with deliverables and timeline
- Share case studies and video snippets as proof in outreach messages

**Developer Activation**
- Communicate with your developer network — make sure they know the pilot is happening, what's expected, and that they're excited (not just informed)
- Segment developers by experience level and specialization so you can match quickly when founders sign up

**Community & Distribution**
- Post in communities (Developer Marketing Alliance Slack, relevant Discords, etc.)
- Time these for after website and content are polished — one shot at a first impression

**Launch Day Plan**
- Pick a specific launch date and coordinate: community posts, email sequence finale, social blitz, and personal outreach all hitting within the same 24-48 hour window
- Make it feel like an event, not a slow drip
